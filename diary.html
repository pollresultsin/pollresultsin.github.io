<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspToday, I'm so happy because (here is the picture I just made this page, I haven't uploaded it now) so....<br/></p>

<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI'm here again, see? I made a triangular arrow, click it and it will show the answer, and there is also a . (I'm too lazy and I'm writing about it later).</p>

<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou ask me why I haven't done it for so long, because I won't. Perhaps this is the last generation....</p>
<!-- Part 5 -->
<p align=center>Thursday, November 11, 2021 Clear</p>
<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA long time passed again... My family got me a new computer and saved the D drive file, or I wouldn't have it. By the way, I flipped through my previous code again and found that there was a GIF, and as soon as I looked at his name, it awakened my memory, and I corrected him and put it below, which is this, gif file.</p>
<!-- Part 6 -->
<p align=center> Friday, July 15, 2022 Clear</p>
<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was another sunny day, and the computer had been repaired 3 times for most of the year. </p>

<h1 align=center>here is the new version</h1>
<!-- Part 1 -->
<p align=center>Saturday, March 18, 2023 Clear</p>
<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was another sunny day, and sure enough, my diary was only sunny. I just wrote my homework now, but it's already 4 o'clock. After another half a year, I will also graduate. But it's okay, we've already been in a shift, it's better to keep a diary here, it's much freer, it's very happy, it's much better than forcing me to write. Without further ado, I will continue to write my homework.</p>
<!-- Part 2 -->
<p align=center>Sunday, March 19, 2023 Clear</p>
<p align=center>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspObviously, there is not much homework, but I still have one essay left, it is already afternoon, and I am not sure whether I have finished writing mathematics. Do I write, I don't want to write, I can't live without writing, the diary and the composition are similar, let the true feelings flow on the tip of the pen ... A brief introduction to the current situation. So my page is still too ugly, and the homepage has too few things, and it is not as good as the old version. When to get it...</p>
