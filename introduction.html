<p style="color: #00008B">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHello, I'm Poll_results_in, I'm a primary school student, I don't know where I learned the html anyway, I'm in the 6th grade, parents at this age let me study well, and I have to face junior high school... My real friends don't think they can code, and there will be more friends on the Internet, I don't have as much as them, but I have more time than them.</p>
<p style="color: #00008B">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome people say, "You're your age, it's hard to learn to play here." I actually study well. It's just that the web takes longer than others.</p>
